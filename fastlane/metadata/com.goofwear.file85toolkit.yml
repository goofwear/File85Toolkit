Name: File85Toolkit
Summary: Fast Base85 + LZMA compression and decompression tool
Description: |-
  File85Toolkit is an Android utility app for efficient file compression and decompression.
  It works by first compressing files with **LZMA** (XZ algorithm) and then encoding the 
  compressed data with **Base85**. For decompression, it reverses the process by decoding 
  Base85 and applying LZMA decompression.  

  Features:
   * Compress files with LZMA, encode with Base85
   * Decompress Base85 back to original with LZMA
   * Lightweight and fast
   * Modern Material 3 interface (Jetpack Compose)
   * About screen with credits and open-source licenses
